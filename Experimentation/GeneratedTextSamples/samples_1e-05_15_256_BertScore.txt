<LEVEL:DOC> OBJECTIVES: To compare the mean total antioxidant status (TAS) among 3 glaucoma types, namely: pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), and study its potential association with various clinical glaucoma-parameters. METHODS: In this case-control study, plasma samples were obtained between September 2013 and October 2014 from 340 glaucoma patients (PEG [n=54]; POAG [n=147]; PACG [n=139]), and 351 controls of matching age, gender, ethnicity, and 5 different systemic co-morbidities from King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The TAS in all samples was determined by a colorimetric-based assay. RESULTS: The mean±standard deviation of TAS was significantly lower among cases: 0.77±0.32 than controls: 1.1±0.22, p less than 0.0001. Moreover, the TAS levels were significantly different across the 3 types of glaucoma: 0.86±0.24 in PEG, 0.47±0.32 in POAG, and 0.98±0.41 in PACG (all p less than 0.0001). In addition, there was a significant correlation between TAS and age at onset (Pearson correlation coefficient [R] 0.17, p less than 0.0001), cup/disc ratio (R: -0.13, p=0.004), and number of anti-glaucoma medications (R: -0.16, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that plasma TAS levels are decreased in patients with glaucoma, more so in POAG and PEG than PACG, supporting the hypothesis that decreased antioxidative defense and/or increased oxidative stress may have a critical role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. ||||| PURPOSE: The present study was designed to determine the levels of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) and non-enzymatic antioxidants (vitamins C and E) in aqueous humor of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, aqueous humor of POAG (n = 30) and PACG (n = 30) patients was obtained. For control, aqueous humor of 30 age-matched cataract patients (n = 30) was collected. Activities of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidants levels were measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: A significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities was found in aqueous humor of POAG and PACG patients as compared to cataract patients (p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in catalase activity. The levels of vitamins C and E were significantly lower in the aqueous humor of POAG and PACG as compared to cataract patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a significant increase in oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of POAG and PACG. Determination of oxidative stress in aqueous humor may help in understanding the course of this disease, and oxidative damage might be a relevant target for both prevention and therapy. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To clarify the presence of oxidative stress in patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and PACG. METHODS: Fifty patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma and fifty healthy controls of matched age and gender were included in the study prospectively. Serum samples were obtained to detect the oxidation degradation products malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), protein carbonyl (PC), ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosin (8-OHdG). RESULTS: The concentration of MDA and CD in PACG patients was significantly higher than those of the control subjects (P<0.05, P<0.01). The serum 4-HNE concentrations were increased in PACG patients, but the differences with those of the healthy controls were not statistically significant. Compared to normal subjects, there was significant higher in serum AOPP and PC in PACG patients (P<0.01). PACG patients had higher levels of 8-OHdG in serum with respect to the comparative group of normal subjects (P<0.01). When plasma IMA levels in the PACG group were compared with those in the control group, significant increases in IMA were observed in the former (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that IMA is a new biomarker available for assessing oxidative stress in PCAG. Oxidative stress is an important risk factor in the development of primary angle-closure glaucoma. Increased levels of oxidative stress products may be associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma. ||||| PURPOSE: To analyze oxidative stress in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case-control study including 90 eyes of 90 patients who needed antiglaucomatous surgery in the course of POAG (glaucoma group, n=50) and from patients who were operated of nonpathologic cataracts (cataract group, n=40). Free radical formation via lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (MDA-TBARS) test and total antioxidant status in the aqueous humor samples of both groups were determined. Statistical analyses were carried out in relation to MDA-TBARS and total antioxidant status and their correlations with glaucoma risk factors. RESULTS: Significantly higher MDA-TBARS were detected in the POAG with respect to the comparative group of cataract subjects (P<0.001). Antioxidant activity was significantly lower in the POAG than in the cataract group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous humor samples may be used for determining oxidative and antioxidant status in pathologic processes. Glaucomatous eyes had a significant increase in oxidative status and decreased antioxidant activity in the aqueous humor than the cataract eyes. Oxidative stress may play a pathogenical role in the POAG. ||||| PURPOSE: To establish the antioxidant status of the aqueous humour in glaucoma associated with exfoliation syndrome (XFG) and to compare it to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and cataract patients. METHODS: Patients were diagnosed with POAG, XFG, or cataract (n=25 for each group). Total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP) was measured by chemiluminescence. Ascorbic acid levels and the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured spectrophotometrically.ResultsTRAP value was lower in XFG (28+/-2 microM Trolox) than in POAG (55+/-8 microM Trolox; P<0.001). TRAP values in both glaucomas were lower than the cataract value (124+/-5 microM Trolox; P<0.001). A decrease in ascorbic acid was measured in XFG (230+/-20 microM) compared with POAG (415+/-17 microM; P<0.001). Ascorbic acid in both glaucomas was lower than in cataract (720+/-30 microM; P<0.001). A significant increase in GPx was found in XFG (30+/-2 U/ml) compared with POAG (16+/-3 U/ml). GPx activity in both glaucomas was increased when compared with cataracts (6+/-2 U/ml; P<0.001). A significant increase of 67% in SOD activity was observed in the glaucoma group vscataract group (27+/-3 U/ml; P<0.001), but no changes were found between both glaucomas. CONCLUSIONS: The antioxidant status of the aqueous humour may play a role in the pathophysiology of both glaucomas. ||||| AIM: To investigate the oxidative stress status of the aqueous humor and serum of patients with pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEG) and to measure paraoxonase (PON) and arylesterase (ARE) levels. METHODS: A total of 78 patients were enrolled in the study, with 26 patients in each separate group. The patients were divided into three groups: the first group entailed PEX syndrome patients, while the second group consisted of patients with PEG and the third group involved patients with no additional systemic diseases, other than the diagnosis of cataract as control. Total oxidative stress (TOS), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), PON, and ARE levels in aqueous humor and serum were measured. RESULTS: TAC, PON and arylesterase levels in aqueous humor and serum of the PEX syndrome and PEG patients were significantly decreased compared with control group (P<0.05). TOS values were higher in patients with PEX syndrome and PEG than controls (P<0.05). TAC, PON and ARE levels of aqueous humor did not differ significantly between the PEX syndrome and PEG groups. CONCLUSION: These findings are potentially of significance and add to the growing body of evidence for oxidative stress in PEX syndrome and PEG. Decreased antioxidant defense and increased oxidative stress system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PEX syndrome and PEG. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate total antioxidant status (TAS) in the plasma of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and to compare it to that of the control group. Additionally, we aim to investigate the association of various POAG clinical indices with TAS level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 139 POAG patients and 148 glaucoma-free controls of matching age, sex, and ethnicity. TAS in all samples was determined by spectrophotometric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods.We studied the possible association of the TAS level with various clinical indices relevant to POAG. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) total antioxidant (TAS) value was lower among patients: 0.47 (±0.32), than controls: 0.97 (±0.43) and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001). TAS concentration was not significantly associated neither with the level of intraocular pressure, nor with number of anti-glaucoma medications (p = 0.532 and 0.084 respectively). However, TAS level shows a trend towards reduction with increased severity of glaucoma presented in a reversed significant association with cup/disc ratio (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that TAS decreases in the plasma of POAG patients and that it may play a role in POAG pathogenesis. Association of TAS level with increased cup-to-disc ratio highlights TAS potential role as a predictive-marker for POAG-severity. ||||| PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to establish the antioxidant status and oxidative stress in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (PEG). METHODS: Serum levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as indicators of antioxidant status; and total oxidant status (TOS), nitric oxide (NO), protein carbonyl (PC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicators of oxidative stress were measured from the blood samples of patients with POAG (n = 23), PEG (n = 24) and healthy control subjects (n = 19) by spectrophotometry. RESULTS: Mean TAC level was 0.6 ± 0.1 mmol/L in the POAG group; 0.5 ± 0.1 mmol/L in the PEG group and 1.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L in the control group (p = 0.001). Mean SOD level was 13 ± 0.5 mg/L in the POAG group, 11.6 ± 0.2 mg/L in the PEG group and 9.4 ± 0.6 mg/L in the control group (p = 0.001). Mean TOS level was 19.6 ± 2.6 μmol/L in the POAG group, 21.2 ± 4.2 μmol/L in the PEG group and 15.1 ± 7 μmol/L in the control group (p = 0.001). Mean NO level was 74.3 ± 14.4 µmol/L in the POAG group, 66.1 ± 8.1 µmol/L in the PEG group and 62.3 ± 13.5 µmol/L in the control group (p = 0.005). Mean PC level was 641.5 ± 102.5 nmol/mg in the POAG group, 988.3 ± 214.7 nmol/mg in the PEG group and 654.4 ± 150.7 nmol/mg in the control group (p = 0.001). Mean MDA level was 1.9 ± 0.2 µmol/L in the POAG group, 1.7 ± 0.4 µmol/L in the PEG group and 1.1 ± 0.2 µmol/L in the control group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study are potentially of significance and add to the growing body of evidence for oxidative stress in POAG and PEG. Decreased antioxidant defense and increased oxidative stress system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of POAG and PEG. ||||| BACKGROUND: To evaluate total antioxidant status (TAS) in the plasma of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) patients and to compare it to that of the control group. Additionally, we aim to investigate the association of various PACG clinical indices with TAS level. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 139 PACG patients and 149 glaucoma-free controls of matching age, sex, and ethnicity. TAS in all samples was determined by spectrophotometric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. We studied the possible association of the TAS level with various clinical indices relevant to PACG. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) total antioxidant (TAS) value was almost similar in patients 1 (±0.22) compared to controls 0.97 (±0.43); p = 0.345. Among cases, mean TAS concentration showed a statistically significant lower pattern among subjects with glaucoma onset at the age of ≤ 50 years (p = 0.037) and female subjects (p = 0.014) as well as having a family history of glaucoma (p = 0.010). Interestingly, a statistically significant inverse correlation was detected between TAS concentration and intra ocular pressure (IOP), (R = -0.14, p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: The inverse correlation of TAS level with IOP, highlights TAS potential role as a predictive-marker for PACG-severity. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate total antioxidant status (TAS) in the plasma of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG) patients and to compare this level with a matching control group. Additionally, we aim to investigate the effect of the combined action of the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) mutation status with TAS level on the development of PEG. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 54 PEG patients and 54 controls of matching age, sex, and ethnicity. TAS in all samples was determined by spectrophotometric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. The coding region of LOXL1, where it encompasses both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs1048661 and rs3825942), was sequenced. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) total antioxidant (TAS) value was lower among patients: 0.87 (0.24), range 0.9-1.41 than controls: 1.07 (0.23), range 0.72-1.94, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001: 95%CI: -0.295-0.114). Evaluating the impact of age, sex, and the mutation in addition to the mean TAS value in patients with PEG, a logistic regression analysis was conducted using diseased/not diseased as the outcome of interest (the dependent variable). Results show that, controlling for all other variables, mean TAS value (p<0.0001) and the mutation G/G in rs3825942 (p=0.041) are significant risk factors for PEG. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that TAS decreases in the plasma of PEG patients, suggesting that TAS may have an important role in the pathogenesis of PEG. The combined effect of the "G" allele and the decreased TAS may contribute to the overall pathogenesis of PEG. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate the role of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO), catalase (CAT), and the levels of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured in 40 (15 men and 25 women) patients with POAG and 60 (30 men and 30 women) healthy controls. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the activities of CAT and MPO between the POAG patients and the controls. However, the plasma MDA level was significantly higher in patients than the controls. CONCLUSION: The results of this preliminary study suggest that the possible alterations of plasma MDA levels may be associated with the pathogenesis of POAG, but further research is needed to understand the role of oxidative damage in this important disorder of aging. ||||| PURPOSE: Oxidative stress and antioxidant status in eye tissues may be associated with glaucomatous damage. The aim of this study was to establish the antioxidant status of aqueous humor of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. For this purpose the authors measured the total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP) and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. DESIGN: Case control study. METHODS: Aqueous humor was obtained at the time of surgery from 24 patients with glaucoma and 24 cataract patients; TRAP was measured by chemiluminescence. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes were measured spectrophotometrically. Superoxide dismutase activity was determined by inhibition of the rate of adrenochrome formation at 480 nm. Catalase activity was evaluated by decrease of H(2)O(2) absorbance at 240 nm. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was determined following nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidation at 340 nm. RESULTS: Total reactive antioxidant potential value of the cataract group was 124 +/- 5 micromol/l Trolox. This value was significantly decreased, by 64%, in glaucoma patients. An increase of 57% in SOD activity was observed in glaucoma patients when compared with cataract patients (41.7 +/- 2.7 U SOD/ml). Glutathione activity was threefold higher in glaucoma patients than in the cataract group (6.1 +/- 0.6 U/ml). No significant changes were found in catalase levels. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress may lead to an induction of antioxidant enzymes and contribute to TRAP decrease. Superoxide dismutase, GPx activities, and TRAP may be useful oxidative stress markers in aqueous humor of glaucoma patients. ||||| BACKGROUND: The involvement of local and systemic oxidative stress in intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and optic nerve damage has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. To test this, we measured the systemic levels of prooxidants and antioxidants by analyzing the blood biochemistry in patients with glaucoma. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from Japanese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (PG) (n = 206), exfoliation syndrome (EX) (n = 199), and controls (n = 126). Plasma levels of lipid peroxides, ferric-reducing activity, and thiol antioxidant activity were measured by diacron reactive oxygen metabolites (dROM), biological antioxidant potential (BAP), and sulfhydryl (SH) tests, respectively, using a free radical analyzer. RESULTS: In the PG, EX, and control groups, the mean ± standard deviation values were 355±63, 357±69, and 348±56 (U. Carr), respectively, for dROM; 1,951±282, 1,969±252, and 2,033±252 (µmol/L), respectively, for BAP (µmol/L); and 614±98, 584±91, and 617±99 (µmol/L), respectively, for SH. The differences in the BAP values were significant between the PG and control groups (p = 0.0062), for SH between the EX and control groups (p = 0.0017), and for SH between the PG and EX groups (p = 0.0026). After adjustment for differences in age and sex among groups using multiple regression analysis, lower BAP values were correlated significantly with PG (p = 0.0155) and EX (p = 0.0049). Higher dROM values with and without glaucoma were correlated with female gender, and lower SH values with older age. There were no significant differences between the higher (≥21 mmHg) and lower (<21 mmHg) baseline IOPs in the PG group or between the presence or absence of glaucoma in the EX group. CONCLUSIONS: Lower systemic antioxidant capacity that measured by ferric-reducing activity is involved in the pathogenesis of PG and EX. ||||| BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to determine whether total oxidant and antioxidant status, total thiol levels and activities of serum paraoxonase 1, an HDL-associated antioxidant enzyme, are related with pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PG). METHODS: Serum samples from 32 PEX, 30 PG, and 32 control subjects were collected at the Gülhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara. Basal paraoxonase (PON1), salt stimulated paraoxonase (stPON1), arylesterase (ARE), and total thiol levels were measured spectrophotometrically. Total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were determined on an autoanalyzer. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated using the TAS and TOS values. PON1 phenotypes were calculated from the ratio of stPON1 to ARE. Continuous variables were compared by independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA, except for age which was compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test (PON1 phenotypes) or chi-square test (gender). RESULTS: TAS levels were significantly lower in PEX and PG patients compared to controls. TOS, OSI and total thiol levels did not differ significantly among the study groups, although there was a trend towards lower TOS and total thiol levels in patients compared to controls. PON1 activities were significantly higher in PEX patients (131.37 +/- 81.20 U/L) compared to controls (95.53 +/- 55.65 U/L; p = 0.046). The PON1 phenotype which is known to have high activity towards the substrate paraoxon, but low antioxidant activity (BB phenotype) was observed significantly more in PEX patients compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: PON1 phenotypes and lack of antioxidants might play an important role in the development of PEX/ PG. ||||| The purpose of this work was to investigate the expression of glutamine synthase (GS), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione transferase (GST) in the aqueous humor of patients with primary open angle glaucoma and controls. Aqueous humor proteome was analyzed by antibody microarray. The expression of tested proteins was detected by protein Cy3/Cy5 labeling, column purification and hybridization on antibody-spotted glass microarray. Fluorescent signals were detected by fluorescence laser scanning. Aqueous humor levels of SOD as well as of GST were significantly lower (2.0- and 2.2-fold, p < 0.01) among patients than controls; both NOS and GS expression were significantly higher (2.2- and 2.6 fold, p < 0.01) among patients than controls. Our data showed substantial differences of GS, NOS2, SOD and GST aqueous humor levels between glaucomatous patients and controls as measured by antibody microarray technology. The overproduction of NO through inducible NOS can form toxic products and change the metabolic conditions of the TM. The GS over-expression might be related to neuronal injury or to the potential role of glutamate as a modulator in the ciliary body signaling. The reduced expression of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and GST could aggravate the unbalance between both oxygen- and nitrogen-derived free radicals production and detoxification. Based on our results, GS, NOS2, SOD and GST as measured by antibody microarray technology may be useful oxidative markers in aqueous humor of glaucomatous patients. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the blood and aqueous humor of glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous patients. To measure the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate/adenosine monophosphate (ATP/ADP/AMP) concentration as a biomarker of the blood energy charge potential. METHODS: We examined 40 consecutive patients with primary open-angle glaucoma scheduled for cataract surgery. Twenty-six age-matched subjects scheduled for cataract surgery were enrolled as a control group. Blood and aqueous humor samples were collected at the time of surgery. MDA concentrations and blood nucleotides were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. The TAC of the samples was estimated with the oxygen-radical absorbance capacity method. RESULTS: Blood and aqueous humor MDA levels in glaucoma patients (respectively, 0.976±0.370 and 0.145±0.065 μmol/ml) were significantly increased (p<0.001 for both) over those of the control group (respectively, 0.454±0.395 and 0.060±0.039 μmol/ml). In contrast, the control group presented significantly higher TACs than did the glaucoma group in both the blood (control: 2.681±1.101 and glaucoma: 1.617±0.674 μmol Trolox Equi/g; p<0.001) and aqueous humor (control: 0.963±0.302 and glaucoma: 0.788±0.346 μmol Trolox Equi/g; p=0.039). The control group (0.869±0.037) exhibited statistically significant (p<0.001) higher values of blood adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate (ATP-ADP) levels than did the glaucoma group (0.791±0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Our data further support the hypothesis that oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant defenses are involved in glaucoma. High-performance liquid chromatography appears to be an effective and sensitive method to detect altered levels of oxidative stress markers in glaucoma patients. ||||| PURPOSE: The importance of oxidative stress in both the formation and the course of glaucoma has been known. Among the antioxidants, vitamin E possesses the specific effects and regulatory mechanisms of a neurohormone. The serum oxidant/antioxidant profile is reportedly altered in ocular pathologies. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the clinical parameters of glaucoma and biochemical data on antioxidants and serum oxidative stress markers as oxidation degradation products. METHODS: In this multicenter case control study, control and patient groups consisted of 31 healthy individuals and 160 glaucoma patients with no known additional abnormalities, respectively. We analyzed the oxidation degradation products malonyl dialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), antioxidants, vitamins E and A, Serine (Ser), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), transferrine (TF), and total antioxidant capacity (TADA). All of these parameters and their relationships with serum cholesterol, glucose, protein, albumin, triglyceride levels, age, gender, visual acuities, intraocular pressure (IOP), c/d ratio, gonioscopic findings, medications, presence of pseudoexfoliation (px), central visual field and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data, pachymetry, and Laplace values, were evaluated individually. Statistical comparisons were performed among them, and with the control group as well. RESULTS: TADA, AOPP, SOD, and Gpx were found to be decreased, and MDA, Ser, TF, vitamins A and E increased in the patient group. All data, excluding AOPP, varied significantly. Vitamin E was the most consistent parameter. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the association between glaucoma and lipid oxidation was shown on a systematic basis, and the significance of vitamin E as a neuroprotective agent has been revealed once more. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate DNA damage markers and the antioxidant status of serum and aqueous humor in glaucoma patients. METHODS: Aqueous humor and serum samples were obtained at the time of surgery from 28 patients with glaucoma and 27 patients with cataracts. Total antioxidant status (TAS) and 8-hydroxy-2´-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels of all samples were determined by spectrophotometric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. RESULTS: Aqueous levels of 8-OHdG were higher in glaucoma patients than in the cataract group (4.61±2.97 ng/ml versus 1.98±0.70 ng/ml, p=0.002). Serum levels of 8-OHdG were also higher in glaucoma patients than in the cataract group (17.80±8.06 ng/ml versus 13.63±3.54 ng/ml, p=0.046). The TAS levels of serum (0.55±0.13 mmol/lit versus 0.70±0.14, p=0.001), and aqueous humor (0.23±0.13 mmol/lit versus 0.34±0.15, p=0.001) in glaucoma patients were lower than in cataract patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that oxidative DNA damage increases and TAS decreases in the serum and aqueous humor of glaucoma patients. These findings support the hypothesis that the formation of reactive oxygen species and/or a decrease in TAS may have an important role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate the levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in human eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and to correlate their concentrations with severity of glaucoma. DESIGN: A prospective cases control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and twenty-five patients with senile cataracts of matched age and gender were included in the study prospectively. Aqueous humor samples were obtained by paracentesis at the time of elective surgery for glaucomatous and cataractous patients. Aqueous humor were analyzed for CAT, GPO, SOD, and MDA status. RESULTS: GPO, SOD, and MDA enzyme levels revealed a high significant increase in aqueous humor of POAG patients with respect to the comparative group of cataract patients (P < 0.001). No significant difference in the activity of CAT enzyme in aqueous humor of POAG and cataract patient (P = 0.201). Significant correlation was found between the MDA enzyme level and severe visual field loss (P < 0.001) in POAG patients. CONCLUSION: Increased levels of aqueous humor GPO, SOD, and MDA may be associated with POAG. In addition, they may be useful antioxidant enzyme levels in aqueous humor of POAG patients as a result of glaucoma disease and not a cause. ||||| Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of blindness in the industrial countries. It is reported that oxidative stress might be an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of POAG. Forty subjects including 20 patients with open-angle glaucoma (9 men and 12 women, mean age 61.8±12.1yr) and 20 controls without glaucoma symptoms (9 men and 12 women, mean age 58.1±17.7yr) were enrolled in our study. The main aim of the work was to evaluate oxidative stress markers in the pathogenesis of open-angle glaucoma. In our work the activity of antioxidant enzymes: catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) as well as the total antioxidant status (TAS) was estimated. An alkaline comet assay was used to measure DNA damage of strand breaks (SB), oxidized purines as glicosylo-formamido-glicosylase (Fpg) sites, and oxidized pirmidines as endonuclease III (Nth) sites. We measured endogenous as well as exogenous DNA damage after 10μM hydrogen peroxide treatment (H(2)O(2)). We did not observe any statistical changes of DNA strand break lesion in examined POAG patients according to healthy subjects (P>0.05). However, either endogenous (P<0.01) or exogenous (P<0.001) levels of oxidative DNA damage in POAG patients were found to be statistically higher than controls. A significant decrease of antioxidant enzymes: CAT (P<0.001), SOD (P<0.05), and GPX (P<0.001) and a non-statistical decrease of TAS status (P>0.05) in glaucoma patients according to controls were also indicated. In conclusion our data revealed that oxidative stress had a pathogenic role in primary open-angle glaucoma. Therefore, we suggested that the modulation of a pro-oxidant/antioxidant status might be a relevant target for glaucoma prevention and therapy. ||||| BACKGROUND: This study was designed to examine oxidative and antioxidative changes in the red blood cells (RBCs) of patients presenting with glaucomatous degeneration. METHODS: The experimental design was a case-control study of strictly selected patients who required antiglaucomatous surgery during primary open-angle glaucoma despite relatively regulated intraocular pressure (IOP) (POAG group, n = 30) and patients who underwent an operation for nonpathological cataracts (cataract group, n = 25). The activities of total superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT), as well as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), were measured. Glaucomatous damage was estimated from a transient pattern electroretinogram. RESULTS: Significant increases in GPX (p = 0.026) and CAT (p = 0.000) activity were noted in the RBCs of POAG patients compared to those of cataract patients. Although SOD was elevated in patients with POAG, the differences compared to cataract controls were not significant (p = 0.079). MDA concentrations were significantly increased in the glaucoma group compared to the cataract controls. CONCLUSION: An oxidative disorder primarily represented by catalase upregulation was observed during the course of glaucoma. ||||| PURPOSE: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of glaucoma, cataract, and many degenerative diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the systemic oxidative stress in black-African patients diagnosed with primary glaucoma or age-related cataract (ARC) and compare these indices to normal control patients and between the two conditions. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of consecutive recruited subjects attending a tertiary care facility. One hundred adults were enrolled and sub-grouped into: Normal controls (n = 20), patients with primary glaucoma (n = 40), and patients with cataract (n = 40). The data were collected on patient demographics and clinical information. Ten milliliters of the venous blood was taken from each subject for the evaluation of serum biochemical indices of oxidative stress. Laboratory measurements of enzymatic and nonenzymic anti-oxidants, as well as lipid peroxidation, were conducted using established and validated spectrophotometric methods. The systemic oxidative stress was measured by the serum levels of anti-oxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation, and compared between the groups and to a control group of patients. RESULTS: Statistically, significantly reduced serum levels of glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbic acid were found in the patients with glaucoma or cataract when compared with controls (P < 0.05 for all). Differences in serum lipid peroxidation levels across or between the groups were nonsignificant. Serum protein levels were significantly higher among the subjects with cataract or glaucoma than in controls. CONCLUSION: Our results concur with findings in Caucasian study cohorts. This indicates that in black-Africans, primary glaucoma, and ARC are associated with increased systemic oxidative stress. This supports the existing evidence on the role of oxidative stress in these ocular disorders and reinforces the rationale for the use of anti-oxidants in the management and possible prevention of these conditions.

In conclusion, oxidative stress increased in glaucoma, both in serum and aqueous humor. Malonyldialdehyde seemed the best biomarkers of oxidative stress in serum. The increase of some antioxidant markers could be a protective response of the eye against oxidative stress.
