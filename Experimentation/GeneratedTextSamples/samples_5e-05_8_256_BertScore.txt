<LEVEL:CLAIM> Primary small-incision cataract surgery using phacoemulsification and foldable intraocular lens implantation may be the procedure of choice in patients with medically controlled glaucoma and coexisting visually significant cataracts, considering the highest preoperative IOP and number of antiglaucoma medications in POAG and PACG, and the area of peripheral anterior synechiae in PACG. ||||| On AS-OCT evaluation, ACA in eyes with PACG opened and widened significantly after phaco-GSL in our study. ||||| The treatment of phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, and goniosynechialysis is safe and effective for patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma and cataract. ||||| Combined phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, and goniosynechialysis appears to be a preferred method for the treatment of PACG and cataract because it seems to have the same efficacy as phacotrabeculectomy and has much less surgical complications. ||||| Phacoemulsification alone, combined phacoemulsification/goniosynechialysis, and combined phacoemulsification/trabeculectomy provide safe, effective, predictable, and stable options of cataract surgery for treatment of ACG with concomitant cataract. ||||| However, only eyes undergoing GSL combined with standard phacoemulsification had significantly increased TOF, reduced glaucoma medication dependence and PAS postoperatively.

<LEVEL:DOC> PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the effect of early aqueous suppression (therapy) on hypertensive phase (HP) and intraocular pressure (IOP) control after implantation of silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent AGV implantation were randomized to initiate therapy (including β-blockers, α-agonists, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) when postoperative IOP>10 mm Hg (low-IOP initiation group) or >17 mm Hg (moderate-IOP initiation group). HP was defined as an IOP>21 mm Hg during the first 6 postoperative months, after an initial IOP reduction to <22 mm Hg in the first postoperative week. Primary outcome measures included the occurrence of HP and IOP control. RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes (50 patients) underwent AGV implantation. Average follow-up was 21.9±10.7 months. HP was observed in 21 eyes (40.4%) with average peak IOP of 30±8 mm Hg, onset at 32±30 days, and duration of 15±32 days. One year postoperatively, those eyes with HP had higher IOP than eyes that did not develop HP (15.1±5.2, 11.4±4.3, respectively; P=0.021) and required more additional glaucoma surgeries (28.6%, 3.2%, respectively; P=0.013). The peak IOP at week 3 postoperatively in the low-IOP initiation group (26 eyes) was significantly lower than in the moderate-IOP initiation group (26 eyes; 15.7±3.6, 20.6±8.9, respectively; P=0.012). Eyes with therapy started after HP onset had significantly higher postoperative IOP from 2 to 4 months. Therapy initiated before the development of HP was not associated with a higher complication rate. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous suppression initiated in the early postoperative period while IOPs were still in the low-teens and was able to reduce the incidence of IOP spike associated with the HP without an increased complication rate. ||||| PURPOSE: To determine the relative efficacy and complications of the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) model FP7 (New World Medical, Ranchos Cucamonga, CA) and the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI) model 101-350 (Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL) in refractory glaucoma. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-six patients, including 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. METHODS: Patients 18 to 85 years of age with refractory glaucoma having intraocular pressure (IOP) of 18 mmHg or more in whom an aqueous shunt was planned were randomized to undergo implantation of either an AGV or a BGI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was failure, defined as IOP >21 mmHg or not reduced by 20% from baseline, IOP ≤5 mmHg, reoperation for glaucoma or removal of implant, or loss of light perception vision. Secondary outcomes included mean IOP, visual acuity, use of supplemental medical therapy, and complications. RESULTS: Preoperative IOP (mean±standard deviation [SD]) was 31.2±11.2 mmHg in the AGV group and 31.8±12.5 mmHg in the BGI group (P = 0.71). At 1 year, mean±SD IOP was 15.4±5.5 mmHg in the AGV group and 13.2±6.8 mmHg in the BGI group (P = 0.007). The mean±SD number of glaucoma medications was 1.8±1.3 in the AGV group and 1.5±1.4 in the BGI group (P = 0.071). The cumulative probability of failure was 16.4% (standard error [SE], 3.1%) in the AGV group and 14.0% (SE, 3.1%) in the BGI group at 1 year (P = 0.52). More patients experienced early postoperative complications in the BGI group (n = 77; 58%) compared with the AGV group (n = 61; 43%; P = 0.016). Serious postoperative complications associated with reoperation, vision loss of ≥2 Snellen lines, or both occurred in 29 patients (20%) in the AGV group and in 45 patients (34%) in the BGI group (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Although the average IOP after 1 year was slightly higher in patients who received an AGV, there were fewer early and serious postoperative complications associated with the use of the AGV than the BGI. ||||| PURPOSE: Previous studies have suggested that primary double-plate Molteno implantation may be beneficial. Therefore, the authors performed a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety of single- versus double-plate Molteno implantation. METHODS: From March 1988 to February 1990, 132 patients who underwent Molteno implantation for medically uncontrollable non-neovascular glaucomas in aphakia or pseudophakia were randomly assigned to receive either single- or double-plate implants. RESULTS: The 1- and 2-year life-table success rates (success [survival] defined as 6 mmHg < or = final intraocular pressure [IOP] < or = 21 mmHg without additional glaucoma surgery or devastating complication) were 55% and 46% with single-plate implantation and 86% and 71% with double-plate implantation, respectively. The final postoperative visual acuities were within one line of the preoperative visual acuities or had improved in 73% and 80% of patients, respectively. Choroidal hemorrhages and/or effusions, corneal decompensation, flat anterior chambers, and phthisis bulbi were more common in the patients who had undergone double-plate Molteno implantation; however, transient elevations of IOP during the first few postoperative months were more common in the patients who had undergone single-plate Molteno implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Double-plate Molteno implantation more frequently affords IOP control than single-plate Molteno implantation; however, double plates are associated with greater risks of choroidal hemorrhages and/or effusions, corneal decompensation, flat anterior chambers, and phthisis bulbi. ||||| PURPOSE: The Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison (ABC) Study compares the long-term outcomes and complications of the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV; model FP7; New World Medical, Los Ranchos, CA) and the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI; model 101-350; Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL). DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seventy-six glaucoma patients at 16 clinical centers worldwide who were 18 to 85 years of age with inadequately controlled intraocular pressure (IOP; ≥18 mmHg) in whom placement of an aqueous shunt was planned. METHODS: Study patients were randomized to undergo implantation of an AGV or a BGI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure, defined as IOP >21 mmHg or not reduced by 20% less than baseline or IOP ≤5 mmHg (2 consecutive visits after 3 months), additional glaucoma surgery, removal of the implant, or loss of light perception vision. RESULTS: A total of 276 patients were enrolled between October 2006 and April 2008, including 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. The mean age±standard deviation (SD) of patients enrolled was 63±14 years, and 52% were male. The mean baseline IOP±SD was 31.5±11.8 mmHg. Except for a 13% higher prevalence of hypertension in the AGV group, no significant differences in baseline demographic or ocular characteristics were observed between the study groups. Intraoperative complications occurred in 11 (8%) patients in the AGV group and in 16 (12%) patients in the BGI group (P = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: The ABC Study should yield valuable prospective data comparing 2 commonly used aqueous shunts in clinical practice. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate the short-term efficacy of a biodegradable collagen matrix (BCM) as an adjuvant for Ahmed valve implantation surgery to prevent the hypertensive phase. METHODS: This prospective study included 43 refractory glaucoma eyes, all followed for 6 months. Refractory glaucoma was defined as an IOP higher than 20 mm Hg with antiglaucoma eye drops without previous glaucoma surgery. Conventional method was performed in 21 eyes and BCM-augmented Ahmed valve implantation (BAAVI) in 22 eyes. In the BAAVI group, a 10 × 10 × 2-mm BCM was sutured on an Ahmed glaucoma valve FP7 model. Complete success was defined as an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower (target IOP 1) or 17 mm Hg or lower (target IOP 2) without antiglaucoma medications and qualified success as an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower with or without medications. Maximal bleb thickness was measured using anterior segment optical coherence tomography images. RESULTS: The preoperative IOPs and numbers of preoperative antiglaucoma medications were similar for both groups. Complete target IOP 1 success rates were 38.1% and 86.4%, complete target IOP 2 success rates were 19.0% and 59.1%, and qualified success rates were 52.4% and 90.9% in the conventional and BAAVI groups, respectively (P < 0.05). The hypertensive phase rate was lower in the BAAVI group (4.5% vs. 47.6%, P = 0.002). Maximal bleb thickness was increased in the BAAVI group on postoperative days 30 and 180 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Success rates were higher in the BAAVI group than in the conventional group with the change of bleb morphology. Furthermore, use of BCM significantly decreased the need for antiglaucoma medications for at least 6 months postoperatively. ||||| PURPOSE: To describe postoperative complications encountered in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study during 5 years of follow-up. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTINGS: Seventeen clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥18 mm Hg and ≤40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Tube shunt (350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant) or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC 0.4 mg/mL for 4 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical complications, reoperations for complications, visual acuity, and cataract progression. RESULTS: Early postoperative complications occurred in 22 patients (21%) in the tube group and 39 patients (37%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.012). Late postoperative complications developed in 36 patients (34%) in the tube group and 38 patients (36%) in the trabeculectomy group during 5 years of follow-up (P =.81). The rate of reoperation for complications was 22% in the tube group and 18% in the trabeculectomy group (P =.29). Cataract extraction was performed in 13 phakic eyes (54%) in the tube group and 9 phakic eyes (43%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.43). CONCLUSIONS: A large number of surgical complications were observed in the TVT Study, but most were transient and self-limited. The incidence of early postoperative complications was higher following trabeculectomy with MMC than tube shunt surgery. The rates of late postoperative complications, reoperation for complications, and cataract extraction were similar with both surgical procedures after 5 years of follow-up. ||||| PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of the partial ligation of a silicone tube of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation to prevent early postoperative hypotony. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two Korean patients were divided into two groups. Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation was performed with or without partial ligation in 16 eyes. The incidence of complications and the success rate in each group were compared. RESULTS: In the partial-ligation group, 10 patients (62.5%) had successful intraocular pressure control (> 5 to < 22 mm Hg) without any additional antiglaucoma medications, whereas intraocular pressure in 12 patients (75.0%) was controlled with or without additional antiglaucoma medications. In the nonligation group, nine patients (56.3%) had successful intraocular pressure control without any additional medications, whereas intraocular pressure in 12 patients (75.0%) was controlled with or without additional antiglaucoma medications. Early postoperative hypotony occurred in 1 of 16 (6.3%) patients with partial ligation and 4 of 16 (25%) patients without ligation. CONCLUSION: The partial ligation of a tube in Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation suggested a lower rate of hypotony and surgical complications. There was no significant difference in final success rate between the partial ligation and nonligation groups. ||||| PURPOSE: The Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study will compare the safety and efficacy of nonvalved tube shunt surgery to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in patients with previous intraocular surgery. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTING: 17 Clinical Centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who have undergone previous trabeculectomy, cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, or both and have inadequately controlled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) >or=18 mm Hg and <or=40 mm Hg on tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Study patients were randomized to undergo placement of a 350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (0.4 mg/ml for 4 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP, complication rates, visual acuity, visual field, quality of life, reoperations for glaucoma, and need for supplemental medical therapy. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were enrolled between October 1999 and April 2004. The age of the study population was 71.0 +/- 10.4 years (mean +/- SD), and 53% were women. The baseline IOP was 25.3 +/- 5.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). There were no significant differences in the demographic and ocular characteristics between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Practice patterns vary in the surgical management of glaucoma, and there are differing opinions among glaucoma surgeons regarding the preferred surgical approach in patients who have undergone previous cataract extraction and/or failed filtering surgery. Forthcoming data from the TVT Study should provide valuable information comparing two surgical procedures commonly used in this patient population. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (T+MMC) and Ahmed glaucoma implant with MMC (AGI+MMC) in treatment of aphakic glaucoma in children below 16 years of age. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects less than 16 years of age who had previously undergone anterior lensectomy and vitrectomy for treatment of congenital cataract with unresponsive aphakic glaucoma (at least on 2 medications) were allocated in 2 groups: trabeculectomy with MMC (group A, 15 eyes) and AGI (group B, 15 eyes). METHODS: Fifteen eyes in each group underwent T+MMC or AGI+MMC. Complete and qualified success were defined as 5< or =intraocular pressure< or =21 mm Hg without and with medication, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and complications. RESULTS: Complete and qualified success rates were 33.3% and 40% in T+MMC group versus 20% and 66.7% in AGI+MMC group, respectively (P=0.36). Mean follow-up was 14.8 and 13.1 months and complication rates were 40% and 26.7% (P=0.44), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: T+MMC and AGI+MMC are comparable in terms of success rate and complications in pediatric aphakic glaucoma. PRECIS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy for MMC trabeculectomy and AGI in the treatment of pediatric aphakic glaucoma. ||||| BACKGROUND: To determine the safety and efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab therapy before and after Ahmed tube insertion for open-angle glaucoma as a means of optimizing postoperative intraocular pressure control. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Open-angle glaucoma patients scheduled for Ahmed tube insertion, randomized to ranibizumab or control groups. METHODS: Ranibizumab (0.5 mg in 0.05 mL) was administered intravitreally at three time points: 9 days prior to surgery, 1 month post-surgery and 2 months post-surgery. Control patients underwent the same procedure without ranibizumab. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Success at 6 months postoperatively was defined as intraocular pressure <18 mmHg with no adjunctive medications or intraocular pressure <15 mmHg with one adjunctive medication. RESULTS: The study and control arms included six and five subjects, respectively, with four in each arm undergoing combined cataract surgery. In the ranibizumab arm, the preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure/medication usage was 21.0 ± 6.7 mmHg on 3.2 ± 1.5 medications and 14.7 ± 1.9 mmHg on 0.5 ± 0.8 medications, respectively. In the control arm, preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure/medication usage was 18.8 ± 3.8 mmHg on 2.8 ± 1.3 medications and 16.2 ± 3.6 mmHg with 1.8 ± 1.6 medications, respectively. Success was achieved in 83% of subjects in the ranibizumab group compared with 40% in the control group (two-tailed Fisher's exact test, P = 0.24). CONCLUSION: The findings from this small pilot comparative study suggest that intravitreal ranibizumab use may be a safe and potentially effective adjunctive treatment modality in improving success after Ahmed tube placement. ||||| PURPOSE: To report 5-year treatment outcomes in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTINGS: Seventeen clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥18 mm Hg and ≤40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Tube shunt (350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant) or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C ([MMC]; 0.4 mg/mL for 4 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP, visual acuity, use of supplemental medical therapy, and failure (IOP >21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20%, IOP ≤5 mm Hg, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision). RESULTS: A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled, including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group. At 5 years, IOP (mean ± SD) was 14.4 ± 6.9 mm Hg in the tube group and 12.6 ± 5.9 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (P =.12). The number of glaucoma medications (mean ± SD) was 1.4 ± 1.3 in the tube group and 1.2 ± 1.5 in the trabeculectomy group (P =.23). The cumulative probability of failure during 5 years of follow-up was 29.8% in the tube group and 46.9% in the trabeculectomy group (P =.002; hazard ratio = 2.15; 95% confidence interval = 1.30 to 3.56). The rate of reoperation for glaucoma was 9% in the tube group and 29% in the trabeculectomy group (P =.025). CONCLUSIONS: Tube shunt surgery had a higher success rate compared to trabeculectomy with MMC during 5 years of follow-up in the TVT Study. Both procedures were associated with similar IOP reduction and use of supplemental medical therapy at 5 years. Additional glaucoma surgery was needed more frequently after trabeculectomy with MMC than tube shunt placement. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To report the design, baseline patient characteristics, and intraoperative complications of the Ahmed Versus Baerveldt (AVB) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were recruited from 7 international clinical sites and treated by 10 surgeons between 2005 and 2009. Inclusion criteria required that patients be at least 18 years of age and have uncontrolled glaucoma refractory to medicinal, laser, and surgical therapy. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to undergo implantation of an Ahmed-FP7 valve (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) or a Baerveldt-350 implant (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA) using standardized surgical technique, to be followed for 5 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was failure, defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) out of target range (5-18 mmHg with ≥ 20% reduction from baseline) for 2 consecutive visits after 3 months, vision-threatening complications, additional glaucoma procedures, or loss of light perception. Secondary outcome measures included IOP, medication use, visual acuity, complications, and interventions. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were enrolled in the study; 124 received the Ahmed-FP7 valve implant and 114 received the Baerveldt-350 implant. The 2 treatment groups did not differ in any baseline characteristics with the exception of sex. The mean age of the study group was 66 ± 16 years, and 55% were women, with a greater proportion in the Baerveldt group (P=0.01). The mean baseline IOP of the study group was 31.4 ± 10.8 on a mean of 3.1 ± 1.0 glaucoma medications. The median Snellen visual acuity was 20/100, mean number of previous laser therapies was 0.9 ± 1.1, and mean number of previous surgeries was 1.7 ± 1.2. Five (4%) patients in the Ahmed group and 4 (4%) patients in the Baerveldt group experienced significant intraoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Aqueous drainage devices are being increasingly used for glaucoma refractory to conventional treatment, and the AVB Study compares the 2 most commonly implanted devices. The 2 groups had similar baseline characteristics, and there were a similar number of intraoperative complications for both devices. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references. ||||| PURPOSE: To describe the intraoperative and postoperative complications encountered during the first year of follow-up in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTING: Seventeen clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Two hundred twelve patients aged 18 to 85 years who had undergone previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure > or =18 mm Hg and < or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A 350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical complications, reoperation for complications, visual acuity, and cataract progression. RESULTS: Intraoperative complications occurred in seven patients (7%) in the tube group and 10 patients (10%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.59). Postoperative complications developed in 36 patients (34%) in the tube group and 60 patients (57%) in the trabeculectomy group during the first year of follow-up (P =.001). Surgical complications were associated with reoperation and/or loss of > or =2 lines of Snellen visual acuity in 18 patients (17%) in the tube group and 28 patients (27%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.12). CONCLUSIONS: There were a large number of surgical complications during the first year of follow-up in the study, but most were self-limited. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher after trabeculectomy with MMC than nonvalved tube shunt surgery. Serious complications resulting in reoperation and/or vision loss occurred with similar frequency with both surgical procedures. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To report the longer term results of a randomized, clinical trial comparing the 350-mm2 and the 500-mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implants. DESIGN: Extended follow-up on a randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 1991 and April 1993, 107 patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) due to non-neovascular glaucoma associated with aphakia, pseudophakia, or failed filters were randomly assigned for surgical placement of either the 350-mm or the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant at the Doheny Eye Institute. METHODS: A random-numbers table was used to assign each patient to one of the two groups. Preoperative IOPs and visual acuities were recorded. Clinical records were reviewed to ascertain postoperative IOPs, visual acuities, number of medications used, and implant-related complications that occurred throughout the follow-up period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success was defined as IOP of 6 mmHg or greater and of 21 mmHg or less in two or more consecutive follow-up visits without further glaucoma surgery or loss of light perception attributable to glaucoma. RESULTS: The overall success rates were 87% for the 350-mm2 group and 70% for the 500-mm2 group (P = 0.05). Average follow-up was 37 months (range, 1-76 months) for the 350-mm2 group and 34 months (range, 5-77 months) for the 500-mm2 group. The life-table success rates declined over time for both implant groups, from a high of 98% for the 350-mm2 group and 92% for the 500-mm2 group at 1 year to a cumulative success rate of 79% for the 350-mm2 group and 66% for the 500-mm2 group at 5 years. Visual acuities were better or remained the same in 50% of the patients in the 350-mm2 group and 46% of those in the 500-mm2 group. Complications during the 5-year follow-up were also statistically similar. CONCLUSIONS: The longer term results show that the 350-mm2 Baerveldt implant is more successful than the 500-mm2 implant for overall IOP control. Interval comparisons indicate a higher rate of success for the 350-mm2 implant in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years of implantation. Visual acuities, implant-related complications, and average IOPs were statistically indistinguishable between the two groups. ||||| PURPOSE: To report 3-year results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTING: Seventeen clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy, cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation, or both and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) > or =18 mm Hg and < or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A 350-mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC 0.4 mg/ml for 4 minutes). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP, visual acuity, use of supplemental medical therapy, surgical complications, and failure (IOP >21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20%, IOP < or =5 mm Hg, reoperation for glaucoma, or loss of light perception vision). RESULTS: A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled, including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group. At 3 years, IOP (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]) was 13.0 +/- 4.9 mm Hg in the tube group and 13.3 +/- 6.8 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (P =.78). The number of glaucoma medications (mean +/- SD) was 1.3 +/- 1.3 in the tube group and 1.0 +/- 1.5 in the trabeculectomy group (P =.30). The cumulative probability of failure during the first 3 years of follow-up was 15.1% in the tube group and 30.7% in the trabeculectomy group (P =.010; hazards ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 4.1). Postoperative complications developed in 42 patients (39%) in the tube group and 63 patients (60%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.004). Surgical complications were associated with reoperation and/or loss of > or =2 Snellen lines in 24 patients (22%) in the tube group and 28 patients (27%) in the trabeculectomy group (P =.58). CONCLUSIONS: Tube shunt surgery had a higher success rate compared to trabeculectomy with MMC during the first 3 years of follow-up in the TVT Study. Both procedures were associated with similar IOP reduction and use of supplemental medical therapy at 3 years. While the incidence of postoperative complications was higher following trabeculectomy with MMC relative to tube shunt surgery, most complications were transient and self-limited. ||||| The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to test whether the Schocket shunt with a larger shunt reservoir surface area would provide a lower final intraocular pressure than the double-plate Molteno implant. However, the Molteno implant produced a statistically lower intraocular pressure at 6 months compared with the Schocket shunt. Postoperative visual acuity, glaucoma medications, and complications were not statistically different. ||||| BACKGROUND: The Baerveldt glaucoma implant is a large equatorial aqueous shunting device that is installed through a single-quadrant conjunctival incision. The intermediate-term results of a randomized study comparing the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants are reported. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with medically uncontrollable, nonneovascular glaucomas associated with aphakia, pseudophakia, or failed filters were enrolled in a randomized, prospective study comparing 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants. Surgical success was defined as 6 mmHg < or = final intraocular pressure < or = 21 mmHg without glaucoma reoperation or devastating complication. RESULTS: Of patients with 350- and 500-mm2 implants, 93% and 88%, respectively, achieved surgical success (18-month life-table analysis, P = 0.93). The 500-mm2 implants afforded intraocular pressure control with significantly fewer medications (0.7 versus 1.3; P = 0.006). The postoperative visual acuities remained within one line of the preoperative visual acuities or improved in 62% and 66% of patients in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively (P = 0.93). Complication rates were statistically similar. The most frequent ones in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups, respectively, were serous choroidal effusion (16% and 32%), strabismus (16% and 19%), anterior uveitis (14% and 11%), and corneal or corneal graft edema (11% each). CONCLUSION: The intermediate-term results of the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants were statistically comparable with respect to surgical and visual outcomes, as well as complications, although the larger implant was associated with a higher rate of some complications. However, the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant afforded intraocular pressure control with fewer medications than the 350-mm2 implant. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the long-term results of trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant in the initial surgical management of primary open- and closed-angle glaucoma. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: One eye each of consecutive patients with primary glaucoma and without prior intraocular surgery was randomized to receive either trabeculectomy or the Ahmed implant. Large university-affiliated eye hospital in Columbo, Sri Lanka. RESULTS: Of 123 patients, 64 were randomized to trabeculectomy and 59 to the Ahmed implant. With a mean follow-up of 31 months, the trabeculectomy group had statistically lower intraocular pressures (IOP) during the first postoperative year. After the first year, the IOPs were comparable. No statistically significant differences between groups were noted for postoperative visual acuity, visual field, anterior chamber depth, and short-term or long-term complications. Adjunctive medication requirement was comparable for both groups. The cumulative probabilities of success (IOP <21 mm Hg and at least 15% reduction in IOP from preoperative levels) at the final follow-up period (months, 41-52) were 68.1% for trabeculectomy and 69.8% for Ahmed implant (P =.86). CONCLUSIONS: Lower IOPs were noted for the trabeculectomy group during the first year. With longer follow-up, the IOPs and the cumulative probabilities of success were comparable between the two groups. ||||| PURPOSE: To report one-year results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. METHODS: None SETTING: 17 Clinical Centers. STUDY POPULATION: Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure (IOP) > or =18 mm Hg and < or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: 350 mm(2) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP, visual acuity, and reoperation for glaucoma. RESULTS: A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled, including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group. At one year, IOP (mean +/- SD) was 12.4 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in the tube group and 12.7 +/- 5.8 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group (P =.73). The number of glaucoma medications (mean +/- SD) was 1.3 +/- 1.3 in the tube group and 0.5 +/- 0.9 in the trabeculectomy group (P <.001). The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 3.9% in the tube group and 13.5% in the trabeculectomy group (P =.017). CONCLUSIONS: Nonvalved tube shunt surgery was more likely to maintain IOP control and avoid persistent hypotony or reoperation for glaucoma than trabeculectomy with MMC during the first year of follow-up in the TVT Study. Both surgical procedures produced similar IOP reduction at one year, but there was less need for supplemental medical therapy following trabeculectomy with MMC. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the 5-year outcomes of the Ahmed FP7 Glaucoma Valve (AGV) (New World Medical, Cucamonga, CA) and the Baerveldt 101-350 Glaucoma Implant (BGI) (Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL) for the treatment of refractory glaucoma. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 276 patients, including 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 85 years with previous intraocular surgery or refractory glaucoma and intraocular pressure (IOP) of ≥18 mmHg in whom glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) surgery was planned were randomized to implantation of an AGV or a BGI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical failure, IOP, visual acuity (VA), use of glaucoma medications, and complications. RESULTS: At 5 years, IOP (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) was 14.7±4.4 mmHg in the AGV group and 12.7±4.5 mmHg in the BGI group (P = 0.015). The number of glaucoma medications in use at 5 years (mean ± SD) was 2.2±1.4 in the AGV group and 1.8±1.5 in the BGI group (P = 0.28). The cumulative probability of failure during 5 years of follow-up was 44.7% in the AGV group and 39.4% in the BGI group (P = 0.65). The number of subjects failing because of inadequately controlled IOP or reoperation for glaucoma was 46 in the AGV group (80% of AGV failures) and 25 in the BGI group (53% of BGI failures; P = 0.003). Eleven eyes in the AGV group (20% of AGV failures) experienced persistent hypotony, explantation of implant, or loss of light perception compared with 22 eyes (47% of failures) in the BGI group. Change in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA (mean ± SD) at 5 years was 0.42±0.99 in the AGV group and 0.43±0.84 in the BGI group (P = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Similar rates of surgical success were observed with both implants at 5 years. The BGI produced greater IOP reduction and a lower rate of glaucoma reoperation than the AGV, but the BGI was associated with twice as many failures because of safety issues. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the late complications in the Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison Study during 5 years of follow-up. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. METHODS: setting: Sixteen international clinical centers. STUDY POPULATION: Two hundred seventy-six subjects aged 18-85 years with previous intraocular surgery or refractory glaucoma with intraocular pressure of >18 mm Hg. INTERVENTIONS: Ahmed Glaucoma Valve FP7 or Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant BG 101-350. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Late postoperative complications (beyond 3 months), reoperations for complications, and decreased vision from complications. RESULTS: Late complications developed in 56 subjects (46.8 ± 4.8 5-year cumulative % ± SE) in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve group and 67 (56.3 ± 4.7 5-year cumulative % ± SE) in the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant group (P =.082). The cumulative rates of serious complications were 15.9% and 24.7% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant groups, respectively (P =.034), although this was largely driven by subjects who had tube occlusions in the 2 groups (0.8% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve group and 5.7% in the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant group, P =.037). Both groups had a relatively high incidence of persistent diplopia (12%) and corneal edema (20%), although half of the corneal edema cases were likely due to pre-existing causes other than the aqueous shunt. The incidence of tube erosion was 1% and 3% in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant groups, respectively (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term rates of vision-threatening complications and complications resulting in reoperation were higher in the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant than in the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve group over 5 years of follow-up. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of early aqueous suppressant treatment on Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) surgery outcomes. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four eyes of 94 patients with refractory glaucoma. METHODS: After AGV implantation, 47 cases (group 1) received topical timolol-dorzolamide fixed-combination drops twice daily when intraocular pressure (IOP) exceeded 10 mmHg, whereas 47 controls (group 2) received conventional stepwise treatment when IOP exceeded target pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included IOP and success rate (6 mmHg < IOP < 15 mmHg and IOP reduction of at least 30% from baseline). Other outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity, complications, and hypertensive phase frequency. RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 were both followed up for a mean of 45±11.6 and 47.2±7.4 weeks, respectively (P = 0.74). Mixed model analysis revealed a significantly greater IOP reduction in group 1 at all intervals (P<0.001). At 1 year, the cases exhibited a significantly higher success rate (63.2% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.008) and reduced hypertensive phase frequency (23.4% vs. 66.0%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early aqueous suppressant treatment may improve AGV implantation outcomes in terms of IOP reduction, success rate, and hypertensive phase frequency. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of the silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve with and without an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with clinically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma were included in the study; 22 were randomly assigned to the study group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve implant with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide) and 27 to the control group (silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve). IOP was the primary outcome measure in this study. The secondary outcome measure was success, defined by IOP lower than 22 mm Hg and higher than 5 mm Hg, and no serious complications. Success rates in both the groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. IOP levels were compared using mixed linear model analysis to correct for repeated measures correlation. RESULTS: Forty-three patients, 18 in the study group and 25 in the control group, completed the study (follow-up of 12 mo). The mean IOP was significantly lower after 1 year in both the groups (P<0.001). The mean IOP in the first month of follow-up was lower in the study group (control; 20.4±9.7, study; 13.6±6.5, P<0.01). The success rate at 1 year was 78% for the study group and 76% for the control group (P=0.82). Complication rates were not different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in neovascular glaucoma did not affect the intermediate-term success of the silicone Ahmed valve nor reduce the incidence of complications. The mean IOP spike in the first month was lower in the triamcinolone group. ||||| BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The pressure-ridge Molteno implant incorporates a ridge on the proximal episcleral plate to limit aqueous outflow during the immediate postoperative period. This modification is intended to decrease the high incidence of postoperative hypotony and flat anterior chambers following Molteno tube implantation, while avoiding the pressure spikes that can occur with suture ligation of the Molteno tube. This study was devised to compare postoperative intraocular pressure control and complications associated with pressure-ridge Molteno implantation versus a standard Molteno implantation with suture ligation of the tube. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty eyes were prospectively randomized to receive either a pressure-ridge, double-plate Molteno implant or a standard, double-plate Molteno Molteno implant with suture ligation of the tube. RESULTS: Postoperative intraocular pressure was significantly higher at day 1 and week 2 in the suture-ligation implant group, although the final pressure at 12 weeks was not different between the two groups. Six of 15 eyes from the pressure-ridge implant group experienced shallow or flat anterior chambers with hypotony, whereas 5 of 15 eyes from the suture-ligation implant group had significant postoperative pressure spikes. CONCLUSION: Because the ridge effect is unpredictable, further modifications are necessary to prevent postoperative hypotony. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare 3-year outcomes and complications of the Ahmed FP7 Glaucoma Valve (AGV) (New World Medical, Cucamonga, CA) and the Baerveldt Glaucoma Implant (BGI) 101-350 (Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL) for the treatment of refractory glaucoma. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 276 patients: 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 85 years with refractory glaucoma and intraocular pressures (IOPs) ≥ 18 mmHg in whom an aqueous shunt was planned were randomized to an AGV or a BGI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The IOP, visual acuity (VA), supplemental medical therapy, complications, and failure (IOP >21 mmHg or not reduced by 20% from baseline, IOP <5 mmHg, reoperation for glaucoma or removal of implant, or loss of light perception vision). RESULTS: At 3 years, IOP (mean ± standard deviation) was 14.3 ± ± 4.7 mmHg (AGV group) and 13.1 ± 4.5 mmHg (BGI group) (P = 0.086) on 2.0 ± 1.4 and 1.5 ± 1.4 glaucoma medications, respectively (P = 0.020). The cumulative probabilities of failure were 31.3% (standard error [SE], 4.0%) (AGV) and 32.3% (4.2%) (BGI) (P = 0.99). Postoperative complications associated with reoperation or vision loss of >2 Snellen lines occurred in 24 patients (22%) (AGV) and 38 patients (36%) (BGI) (P = 0.035). The mean change in the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA at 3 years was similar (AGV: 0.21 ± 0.88, BGI: 0.26 ± 0.74) in the 2 treatment groups at 3 years (P = 0.66). The cumulative proportion of patients (SE) undergoing reoperation for glaucoma before the 3-year postoperative time point was 14.5% (3.0%) in the AGV group compared with 7.6% (2.4%) in the BGI group (P = 0.053, log rank). The relative risk of reoperation for glaucoma in the AGV group was 2.1 times that of the BGI group (95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.8; P = 0.045, Cox proportional hazards regression). CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the AGV was associated with the need for significantly greater adjunctive medication to achieve equal success relative to implantation of the BGI and resulted in a greater relative risk of reoperation for glaucoma. More subjects experienced serious postoperative complications in the BGI group than in the AGV group. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To report the 1-year treatment outcomes of the Ahmed Versus Baerveldt (AVB) Study. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 238 patients were enrolled in the study, including 124 in the Ahmed group and 114 in the Baerveldt group. METHODS: Patients aged 18 years or older with uncontrolled glaucoma refractory to medicinal, laser, and surgical therapy were randomized to undergo implantation of an Ahmed-FP7 valve (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) or a Baerveldt-350 implant (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA), to be followed for 5 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was failure, defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) out of target range (5-18 mmHg with ≥ 20% reduction from baseline) for 2 consecutive visits after 3 months, vision-threatening complications, additional glaucoma procedures, or loss of light perception. Secondary outcome measures included IOP, medication use, visual acuity, complications, and interventions. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline ocular or demographic characteristics between the study groups with the exception of sex. Preoperatively, the study group had a mean IOP of 31.4 ± 10.8 mmHg on a mean of 3.1 ± 1.0 glaucoma medications with a median Snellen acuity of 20/100. The cumulative probability of failure a 1-year was 43% in the Ahmed group and 28% in the Baerveldt group (P = 0.02). The mean IOP at 1 year was 16.5 ± 5.3 mmHg in the Ahmed group and 13.6 ± 4.8 mmHg in the Baerveldt group (P < 0.001). The mean number of glaucoma medications required was 1.6 ± 1.3 in the Ahmed group and 1.2 ± 1.3 in the Baerveldt group (P = 0.03). Visual acuity was similar in both groups at all visits in the first year (P = 0.66). In the first year after surgery, there were a similar number of patients who experienced postoperative complications in the 2 groups (45% Ahmed, 54% Baerveldt, P = 0.19), but a greater number of patients in the Baerveldt group required interventions (26% Ahmed vs. 42% Baerveldt, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The Baerveldt-350 group had a higher success rate than the Ahmed-FP7 group after 1 year of follow-up, but required a greater number of interventions. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To compare 2 commonly used aqueous drainage devices for the treatment of refractory glaucoma. DESIGN: International, multicenter, randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 years or older with uncontrolled or high-risk glaucoma refractory to maximum medical therapy, many of whom had failed trabeculoplasty and trabeculectomy. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to an Ahmed-FP7 valve implant (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA) or a Baerveldt-350 implant (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc., Santa Ana, CA) using a standardized surgical technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was failure, defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) outside of the target range (5-18 mmHg, with ≥20% reduction from baseline) for 2 consecutive visits after 3 months, vision-threatening complications, de novo glaucoma procedures, or loss of light perception. Secondary outcome measures include IOP, medication use, visual acuity, complications, and interventions. RESULTS: A total of 238 patients were enrolled and randomized; 124 received the Ahmed implant and 114 received the Baerveldt implant. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Half the study group had secondary glaucoma, and 37% had previously failed trabeculectomy. The mean preoperative IOP was 31.4±10.8 mmHg on 3.1±1.0 glaucoma medications. Median baseline Snellen visual acuity was 20/100. At 3 years, the cumulative probability of failure was 51% in the Ahmed group and 34% in the Baerveldt group (P = 0.03). Mean IOP was 15.7±4.8 mmHg in the Ahmed group (49% reduction) and 14.4±5.1 mmHg in the Baerveldt group (55% reduction; P = 0.09). Mean number of glaucoma medications was 1.8±1.4 in the Ahmed group (42% reduction) and 1.1±1.3 in the Baerveldt group (65% reduction; P = 0.002). There was a moderate but similar decrease in visual acuity in both groups (P< 0.001). The 2 groups had similar complication rates (52% Ahmed, 62% Baerveldt; P = 0.12); however, the Baerveldt group had a higher rate of hypotony-related vision-threatening complications (0% Ahmed, 6% Baerveldt; P = 0.005). More interventions were required in the Baerveldt group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (38% Ahmed, 50% Baerveldt; P = 0.07). Most complications were transient, and most interventions were slit-lamp procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Both devices were effective in reducing IOP and glaucoma medications. The Baerveldt group had a lower failure rate and required fewer medications than the Ahmed group after 3 years, but it experienced more hypotony-related vision-threatening complications. ||||| A randomized, prospective study was undertaken to compare the results of the double-plate Molteno implant with those of the anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band (ACTSEB) procedure, described by Schocket, for eyes with complicated glaucoma. One surgeon performed all the procedures. For statistical analysis there were 21 eyes in the ACTSEB group and 19 eyes in the Molteno group, with at least 6 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 26 months; range, 6 to 49 months). Eyes with aphakia/pseudophakia, uveitis, previous penetrating keratoplasty, previous unsuccessful trabeculectomy, and neovascular glaucoma were evenly distributed between the two groups. Mean preoperative intraocular pressures in the ACTSEB and Molteno groups were 35.2 and 34.6 mm Hg, respectively. With the exclusion of one phthisical eye in each group final mean intraocular pressure in the ACTSEB group was 15.1 mm Hg, with a mean of 0.43 medications, and 14.4 mm Hg, with a mean of 0.95 medications, in the Molteno group. Seven (33%) of 21 eyes and 13 (68%) of 19 eyes in the ACTSEB and Molteno groups, respectively, were receiving additional antiglaucoma medication at the most recent visit (P =.027). Final visual acuity was stable (within one Snellen line of baseline visual acuity) or improved in 10 (48%) of 21 eyes in the ACTSEB group compared with 13 (68%) of 19 eyes in the Molteno group. Complications or inadequate pressure control requiring further surgical intervention were seen in nine (47%) of 19 eyes in the Molteno group and 12 (57%) of 21 eyes in the ACTSEB group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implant with and without surface area expansion using pericardial membrane (Preclude) in the treatment of complicated glaucoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten eyes of AGV implant surgery using pericardial membrane (Preclude) that were designed to have surface area of 300 mm (e-AGV group) and 10 eyes of AGV implant surgery without surface area extension (AGV group) were enrolled in this prospective, randomized controlled trial study. RESULTS: Two (20%) of 10 eyes in the e-AGV group, and 8 (80%) of 10 eyes in the AGV group experienced the hypertensive phase (P = 0.007). Complete success rate was 90% in the e-AGV group and 70% in the AGV group (P = 0.291). Mean number of preoperative antiglaucoma medication was 2.4 +/- 0.5 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 for the e-AGV and AGV groups, respectively, and that of postoperative antiglaucoma medication was 0.1 +/- 0.3 and 0.4 +/- 0.7 for the e-AGV and AGV groups, respectively, at final follow-up (P = 0.229). CONCLUSION: Surface area expansion with pericardial membrane (Preclude) in AGV implant surgery resulted in a statistically significantly lower rate of hypertension without causing any postoperative complications. ||||| PURPOSE: To determine whether it is possible to improve the surgical success of Molteno implantation by causing a general suppression of collagen synthesis with postoperative oral prednisolone. METHODS: Twenty-two patients requiring single stage, single-plate Molteno implantation were randomized into two study groups: the control group A and the systemic prednisolone treatment group B. Serum markers of collagen metabolism were monitored. RESULTS: A successful outcome at the end of the 6-month follow-up, defined as final IOP > or =6 mmHg and < or =22 mmHg with less or equal number of antiglaucoma medication as preoperatively and no additional surgery was achieved in 9 of 11 (82 %) patients of group A and in 5 of 10 (50 %) patients of group B (p= 0.18). There was a statistically significant decrease in serum markers of collagen synthesis in the group B but not in the group A. CONCLUSION: The serum markers indicated a systemic effect of oral prednisolone on collagen synthesis in group B but it did not improve the surgical outcome as compared to the controls. ||||| PURPOSE: To compare the short- and intermediate-term results of two commonly used glaucoma surgical procedures, trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was performed at two international centers. One eye each of consecutive patients requiring glaucoma surgery for intraocular pressure control was randomized to receive either trabeculectomy or the Ahmed implant. RESULTS: Of the 117 patients, 62 were randomized to trabeculectomy and 55 to the Ahmed implant. With a mean follow-up of 9.7 months, the trabeculectomy group had statistically lower intraocular pressures at weeks 6 to 15 (12.6 mm Hg vs 16.4 mm Hg) and months 11 to 13 (11.4 mm Hg vs 17.2 mm Hg) than the Ahmed implant group. Compared with preoperative status, no statistically significant differences between groups were noted for visual acuity, visual field, lens status, and final anterior chamber depth. The cumulative probabilities of success (intraocular pressure <21 mm Hg and at least 15% reduction in intraocular pressure from preoperative level) were 83.6% for trabeculectomy and 88.1% for Ahmed implant (P =.43). However, the Ahmed implant group had a greater adjunctive medication requirement. On the last visit, 10 of the trabeculectomy eyes and 19 of the Ahmed implant eyes required at least one topical medication (P =.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower mean intraocular pressures were noted for the trabeculectomy group. All other results, including success (as defined in this study) and frequency of complications, were comparable between the two groups. ||||| PURPOSE: To report 2-year follow-up data after Ahmed valve implantation (New World Medical, Inc) and Molteno single-plate implantation surgical treatment of refractory glaucoma. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative study. METHODS: Patients with refractory glaucoma, defined as uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 21 mm Hg despite maximal antiglaucoma medication, previously failed nonseton surgical treatment, or a combination thereof were included. Ninety-two patients were allocated randomly to each of the study groups and underwent implantation of either the Ahmed valve implant (model FP7; 184 mm(2) surface area) or Molteno single-plate implant (134 mm(2) surface area) and were followed up for 24 months. Main outcome measures were IOP and surgical success rate. Other outcome measures were changes in visual acuity, number of ant-glaucoma medications, mean deviation of visual field, and rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Those who successfully completed the trial (28 in the Molteno group and 29 in the Ahmed group) achieved significantly less IOP and fewer glaucoma medications, but worse visual acuity 24 months after surgery. The Molteno group, compared with the Ahmed group, achieved significantly lower IOPs after the early postoperative period until the end of the study. Both groups reasonably maintained visual field during the follow-up. The rate of surgical failure was comparable in both groups. Median survival time was 24 months for both groups. There were no devastating intraoperative or postoperative complications in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Both Ahmed and Molteno implants successfully preserved visual field, although IOP control was more pronounced in the Molteno implant group. ||||| BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To report on preliminary findings of adjunctive subconjunctival bevacizumab (SCB) injections in patients undergoing Ahmed valve implantation (AVI) (New World Medical, Rancho Cucamonga, CA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institution's ethics committee. Patients were prospectively recruited during a 1-month period and randomized to receive AVI with postoperative SCB (days 1 and 7, n = 7) or AVI without SCB (n = 6). RESULTS: Baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) in the treatment (AVI+SCB) group was 19.4 ± 8.6 mm Hg, whereas baseline IOP in the control (AVI) group was 32.1 ± 17.7 mm Hg (P =.119). Final IOP was 13.8 mm Hg (n = 7) for the treatment group and 12.7 mm Hg for the control group (n = 5, P =.790). One eye in the control group required further glaucoma intervention at day 45 and was considered a failure. The pre-massage postoperative IOP was significantly lower for the treatment group only at day 45 (16.1 vs 26.0 mm Hg, P =.012). Mean post-massage IOP was significantly lower in the treatment group at day 15 (11.28 vs 17.16 mm Hg, P =.004), day 30 (11.28 vs 20.83 mm Hg, P =.015), and day 45 (12.16 vs 21.33 mm Hg, P =.001), and similar at month 3. Mean change in bleb area was 11.4 mm(2) in the treatment group and -0.4 mm(2) in the control group (P =.036 and P =.361, respectively, Student's paired samples t test). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab was associated with a less aggressive hypertensive period as measured by post-massage IOP measurements, postoperative glaucoma medications, and cross-sectional bleb area by ultrasound. Further prospective studies are needed to better understand the utility of SCB at the time of AVI surgery. ||||| OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Ahmed glaucoma valve model M4 (High density porous polyethylene plate; Medpor) compared with the model S2 (polypropylene plate). METHOD: Mexican patients with neovascular glaucoma were randomly included for each group (M4 and S2). They were operated on using conventional techniques and creating a sub-episcleral tunnel to place the valve tube in the anterior chamber. After one year of follow-up, the results were evaluated with respect to a post-operative reduction in pressure, changes in visual acuity, the need for drugs, and complications, as well as the demographic characteristics of each group. Each operation using the M4 valve was performed by a single surgeon (FGC). Those operated on using the S2 model had their surgery performed by the staff surgeons at the Glaucoma Department of the Mexican Association to Prevent Blindness (APEC). RESULTS: Each group (M4 and S2) contained 21 eyes of 21 Mexican patients with a diagnosis of neovascular glaucoma, leading to a total of 42 patients undergoing surgery. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 43.5 (±11.8), and 42.24 (±12.84) mmHg for the M4 and S2 groups, respectively. After one year of follow-up, the IOP reported was 18.9 (±9.7) mmHg for the final 18 patients in the M4 group, and 16.38 (±9.76) mmHg for the 21 patients in the S2 group. DISCUSSION: The design of a drainage valve device such as that of Ahmed has characteristics such as moderate control of IOP, thanks to the valve component in the immediate post-operative period, which makes them safer than other non-valve devices. This avoids an excess of flat chambers and the presence of low IOPs, which can lead to bleeding in the early post-operative period due to the weak desmosomal junctions of the newly formed vessels, with the advantage of maintaining suitable control of IOP from the first day after surgery. CONCLUSION: Further studies with longer follow-up with a larger number of patients are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this porous coating in the control of neovascular glaucoma.

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Information was insufficient to conclude whether there are differences between aqueous shunts and trabeculectomy for glaucoma treatment. While the Baerveldt implant may lower IOP more than the Ahmed implant, the evidence was of moderate-certainty and it is unclear whether the difference in IOP reduction is clinically significant. Overall, methodology and data quality among existing randomized controlled trials of aqueous shunts was heterogeneous across studies, and there are no well-justified or widely accepted generalizations about the superiority of one surgical procedure or device over another.

<LEVEL:DOC> PURPOSE: To validate known and determine new predictors of non-response to ranibizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to incorporate these factors into a prediction rule. METHODS: This multicenter, observational cohort study included 391 patients treated with ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. We performed genetic analysis for single nucleotide polymorphisms in AMD-associated genes and collected questionnaires regarding environmental factors and disease history. The primary outcome was non-response to treatment, defined as a loss of visual acuity ≥30% of letters. RESULTS: Of the 391 patients, 47 were classified as non-responsive. Independent predictors for non-response were age, baseline visual acuity, diabetes mellitus and accumulation of risk alleles in the CFH, ARMS2 and VEGF-A genes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70-0.84). We derived a clinical prediction rule, with possible total risk scores ranging from 0-19 points. The absolute risk of non-response varied from 3-52% between risk score groups. CONCLUSION: This is an important step towards a clinical prediction rule that can aid clinicians in identifying AMD patients with increased likelihood of non-response, and consequently contribute to making shared treatment decisions. ||||| PURPOSE: To study the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin 8, vascular endothelial growth factor, erythropoietin, complement factor H, complement component C3, and LOC387715 genes with the response to bevacizumab treatment in exudative age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: Clinical records, smoking history, optical coherence tomography, and angiographies of 96 bevacizumab-treated exudative age-related macular degeneration patients were analyzed retrospectively. Blood DNA was collected. Based on the disappearance of intra- or subretinal fluid in optical coherence tomography, patients were graded as responders, partial responders, or nonresponders after 3 initial treatment visits and a median time of 3.5 months. RESULTS: Interleukin 8 promoter polymorphism -251A/T was significantly associated with persisting fluid in optical coherence tomography. The A allele was more frequent in nonresponders than in responders (P = 0.033). In multivariate modeling, the AA genotype of -251A/T (P = 0.043) and occult (P = 0.042) or predominantly classic (P = 0.040) lesions predicted poorer outcome. Visual acuity change was better in responders than in nonresponders (P = 0.006). Baseline lesion size (P = 0.006) and retinal cysts after the treatment (P < 0.001) correlated with less visual acuity gain. CONCLUSION: The A allele and the homozygous AA genotype of interleukin 8 -251A/T were associated with anatomical nonresponse to bevacizumab treatment. ||||| PURPOSE: To determine whether different complement factor H (CFH) genotypes play a role in treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with intravitreal bevacizumab. METHODS: In this prospective study, we included 197 patients with exudative AMD and treated with 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab at 6-week intervals until choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was no longer active. In all patients, ophthalmological examinations, visual acuity, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus photography and fluorescein angiography were performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. RESULTS: Age, gender and baseline mean visual acuity were similar among the three CFH genotypes. There was no significant difference in underlying lesion type of CNV, lesion size, number of injections or macula thickness. When examining the effect of genotype on post-treatment visual acuities, we observed a significant worse outcome for distance and reading visual acuity in the CFH 402HH genotype group. The number of patients who lost 3 or more lines in distance and reading visual acuity testing was significantly higher in the CFH 402HH (41%, 46%) genotype group than in patients with the CFH 402YY (28%, 26%) and CFH 402YH (26%, 24%) genotype. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the higher risk for exudative AMD in patients with the CFH 402HH genotype that was found in previous studies, our results show that the CFH 402HH genotype also correlates with lower visual acuity outcome after treatment with bevacizumab, suggesting that pharmacogenetics of CFH plays a role in response to treatment of wet AMD. ||||| OBJECTIVE: Factors influencing the outcome of anti-VEGF treatment in neovascular AMD are still investigated. We analyzed the impact of a loading phase, the significance of an initial response for the long-term and the effect of the CFH polymorphism (p.His402Tyr) on treatment outcome. METHODS: Patients treated with ranibizumab for neovascular AMD were analyzed over a period of 24 months by assessing effects of loading phase, initial response and genotype of CFH rs1061170 (c.1204C>T, p.His402Tyr). RESULTS: 204 eyes were included. A change of +5.0 [-1;+11] letters and +1.5 [-5.5;+9.5] was observed with a median of 4 [3]; [7] and 10 [7]; [14] ranibizumab injections during 12 and 24 months, respectively. Loading phase was no significant predictor for treatment as VA outcome in eyes with and without loading phase was similar (p = 0.846 and p = 0.729) at 12 and 24 months. In contrast, initial response was a significant predictor for improving vision of 5 or more letters at 12 (p = 0.001; OR = 6.75) and 24 months (p = 0.01; OR = 4.66). Furthermore, the CT genotype at CFH rs1061170 was identified as a significant predictor for a favorable VA outcome at 12 and 24 months (OR = 6.75, p = 0.001 and OR = 4.66, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that clinical decisions regarding treatment may be guided by observing patients' initial response as well as their genotype of SNP rs1061170, while the criterion of loading phase may not bear the customary value. ||||| PURPOSE: To evaluate the pharmacogenetic relationship between genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to treatment with ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) or bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech) for neovascular AMD. DESIGN: Clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred thirty-four (73%) of 1149 patients participating in the Comparison of AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) were recruited through 43 CATT clinical centers. METHODS: Each patient was genotyped for SNPs rs1061170 (CFH), rs10490924 (ARMS2), rs11200638 (HTRA1), and rs2230199 (C3), using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Genotypic frequencies were compared with clinical measures of response to therapy at one year, including mean visual acuity (VA), mean change in VA, 15-letter or more increase in VA, retinal thickness, mean change in total foveal thickness, presence of fluid on OCT, presence of leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA), mean change in lesion size, and mean number of injections administered. Differences in response by genotype were evaluated with tests of linear trend calculated from logistic regression models for categorical outcomes and linear regression models for continuous outcomes. To adjust for multiple comparisons, P≤0.01 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in response by genotype were identified for any of the clinical measures studied. Specifically, there were no high-risk alleles that predicted final VA or change in VA, the degree of anatomic response (fluid on OCT or FA, retinal thickness, change in total foveal thickness, change in lesion size), or the number of injections. Furthermore, a stepwise analysis failed to show a significant epistatic interaction among the variants analyzed; that is, response did not vary by the number of risk alleles present. The lack of association was similar whether patients were treated with ranibizumab or bevacizumab or whether they received monthly or pro re nata dosing. CONCLUSIONS: Although specific alleles for CFH, ARMS2, HTRA1, and C3 may predict the development of AMD, they did not predict response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. ||||| PURPOSE: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) resulting in decreased central vision severely impairs affected individuals. Current standard treatment is an intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (ranibizumab), but responses to treatment show large variability. Genetic factors that influence AMD and that affect the outcome of ranibizumab treatment were sought within a sample of Swiss patients. METHODS: Changes in visual acuity (VA) after initiation of anti-VEGF treatment were observed during 12 months, and percentiles of VA were calculated. Genotypes of polymorphisms in known AMD susceptibility loci (CFH, CFB, HTRA1, AMRS2, and VEGFA) as well as not yet reported AMD-associated genes (KDR, LRP5, and FZD4) were determined, and their frequencies were compared. RESULTS: Of the 309 eyes included in the study, 243 completed VA assessment. On average, 3.9 ±2.6 ranibizumab injections were administered. Based on the change in visual acuity, two responder groups were established: 63 eyes were assigned to the poor responders (≤25th percentile) and 63 eyes to the good responders (≥75th percentile). Individuals with genotype CC of p.Y402H in CFH had a decreased chance of positive treatment outcome compared with those with the CT and TT genotypes (P = 0.005 and P = 0.006). In this study, the genotype combination of AG at CFH with CT at FZD4 (SNP rs10898563) promised an increased chance of positive treatment outcome (P = 0.004). Furthermore, the association with the known genetic susceptibility loci CFH, HTRA1, and AMRS2 were confirmed, and a risk-conferring polymorphism in one new locus, LRP5, was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition may account for the variability in response to anti-VEGF treatment. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is an association between known age-related macular degeneration genetic risk variants in the CFH, ARMS2, and HTRA1 genes and response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: A retrospective review of 150 patients with documented wet age-related macular degeneration based on clinical examination and fluorescein angiogram was performed. Patients received anti-VEGF therapy with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab. Patients were genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1061170, rs10490924, rs3750848, rs3793917, rs11200638, and rs932275 and for the indel del443ins54 spanning the CFH, ARMS2, and HTRA1 genes. RESULTS: There were 57 patients who were characterized as negative responders to anti-VEGF therapy, and 93 patients who were characterized as positive responders. There was no significant difference in mean baseline visual acuity between the groups. Negative responders were followed for a mean duration of 24.0 months, while positive responders were followed for a mean duration of 22.0 months. Although the frequency of the at-risk alleles was higher in the positive responders when compared with the negative responder, this did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, there was no significant association between genotype and the number of injections or absolute change in visual acuity in both groups of responders. CONCLUSION: In our patient cohort, there was no statistically significant association between response to anti-VEGF therapy and the genotype in both positive-responder and negative-responder groups. Larger studies with more power are necessary to further determine whether a pharmacogenetic association exists between wet age-related macular degeneration and anti-VEGF therapy. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate whether there is an association between complement factor H (CFH) or LOC387715 genotypes with response to treatment with intravitreal bevacizumab for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: The study cohort consisted of 86 patients being treated for neovascular AMD with bevacizumab alone. METHODS: Genotype determination for the CFH Y402H and LOC387715 A69S polymorphisms was performed by allele-specific digestion of polymerase chain reaction products. All patients were treated with 1.25 mg intravitreal bevacizumab at 6-week intervals until choroidal neovascularization was no longer active. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CFH Y402H and LOC387715 A69S polymorphisms. Choroidal neovascular lesion characteristics were ascertained by fluorescein angiography. Snellen visual acuity (VA) was measured before and after treatment. RESULTS: For the CFH Y402H polymorphism, patients with the CFH TT genotype had the largest choroidal neovascular lesions (P = 0.02). With treatment, VA improved from 20/248 to 20/166 for the CFH TT genotype and from 20/206 to 20/170 for the TC genotype, but fell from 20/206 to 20/341 for the CFH CC genotype (P = 0.016). Only 10.5% of patients with the CFH CC genotype demonstrated improved VA with treatment, compared with 53.7% of CFH TT and TC genotypes (P = 0.004). For the LOC387715 A69S variant, patients with the TT genotype had the largest choroidal neovascular lesions (P = 0.012). There was no significant difference in response to bevacizumab treatment according to LOC387715 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The AMD-associated CFH Y402H and LOC387715 A69S variants were associated with differences in choroidal neovascular lesion size in this study. Patients with the CFH CC genotype fared significantly worse with intravitreal bevacizumab than did those with the CFH TC and TT genotypes, suggesting a potential pharmacogenetic relationship. Prospective studies to confirm or refute this observation should be considered. ||||| AIMS: To investigate an association between genotype for three single nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the early response to treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. METHODS: Best corrected visual acuity letter score was recorded at baseline and each subsequent visit. Age, sex, smoking history, lesion type and the number of injections were also recorded. Genotypes were obtained for rs11200638 in HTRA1, rs1061170 in CFH and rs1413711 in VEGF. Data were analysed with treatment response at month 6 as both a binary (>5 letter improvement vs ≤5 letter gain) and a linear trait. RESULTS: This initial study cohort consisted of 104 Caucasian neovascular AMD patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab. Trends towards a more favourable outcome were seen with the higher AMD risk genotypes in CFH and VEGF in both the linear and binary models and in HTRA1 in the linear model alone. For CFH, mean letter score change after 6 months was +1.6, +5.9 and +7.2 letters for the TT, TC and CC genotypes and a >5 letter gain was seen in 34.6%, 56.6% and 56%, respectively. For VEGF, mean letter score change after 6 months was +1.3, +5.8 and +7.4 letters for the TT, TC and CC genotypes and a >5 letter gain was seen in 40%, 55.8% and 51.9%, respectively. For HTRA1, mean letter score change was +2.2, +7.5 and +2.9 letters for the GG, GA and AA genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports preliminary evidence suggesting that the higher AMD risk genotypes in CFH, VEGF and HTRA1 may influence the short-term response to treatment with ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. ||||| PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of complement factor H (CFH) Y402H CC and TT polymorphisms on treatment response to intravitreal ranibizumab injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: One hundred ninety-three patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to AMD who were monitored for at least 6 months of follow-up, and with at least three ranibizumab injections, were included in the study. At the final examination, an increase in visual acuity (VA) of five letters or more compared to the initial VA was regarded as a good response, and a decrease in VA of five letters or more compared to the initial VA was evaluated as a poor response. A genetic examination was performed with a PCR melting curve analysis. In the statistical evaluation, SPSS version 18 software was used. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 71.01 (55-86) years, the mean follow-up was 13.34 (6-36) months, and the mean number of injections was 4.02 (3-15). There were 96 patients in the good response group (Group 1) and 97 patients in the poor response group (Group 2). The initial VA in Group 1 was 41.34 (10-64) letters, the initial central macular thickness (CMT) was 213.40 (126-494) µm, and the initial lesion width was 3760 (1430-6430) µm. The initial VA in Group 2 was 52.89 (26-82) letters, the initial CMT was 257.60 (115-882) µm, and the initial lesion width was 4460 (1000-7650) µm. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the initial VA and CMT (p=0.094, p=0.083). However, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups in the width of the initial lesion (p=0.003). In Group 1, 15 CC, 30 TT, and 51 TC alleles were found, and in Group 2, 49 CC, two TT, and 46 TC alleles were found, and the distribution was significantly different between the two groups (p=0.012). The change in the distribution of genotypes was not associated with either the lesion size or VA (p=0.841). Fibrosis developed in 12 patients who were all poor responders. CONCLUSIONS: CFH Y402H CC accompanied a poor response, and TT accompanied a good response in this series of patients with AMD undergoing ranibizumab therapy. ||||| PURPOSE: To ascertain whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGFA), Complement Factor H (CFH), and LOC387715 genes could predict outcome to anti-VEGF therapy for patients with age related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Patients with "wet" AMD were identified by chart review. Baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual acuity (VA) data, and at least 6 months of clinical follow up after 3 initial monthly injections of bevacizumab or ranibizumab were required for inclusion. Based on OCT and VA, patients were categorized into two possible clinical outcomes: (a) responders and (b) non-responders. DNA was extracted from saliva and genotyped for candidate SNPs in the VEGFA, LOC387715, and CFH genes. Clinical outcomes were statistically compared to patient genotypes. RESULTS: 101 patients were recruited, and one eye from each patient was included in the analysis. 97% of samples were successfully genotyped for all SNPs. We found a statistically significant association between the LOC387715 A69S TT genotype and outcome based on OCT. CONCLUSION: Genetic variation may be associated with outcome in patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate factors affecting patient response to intravitreal ranibizumab treatment for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 105 consecutive eyes with AMD treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections and followed for more than 1 year after treatment. Response to ranibizumab treatment was compared between typical neovascular AMD and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Furthermore, we investigated associations of age, lesion size, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CFH and ARMS2 genes with treatment response. RESULTS: Forty-nine eyes were diagnosed with typical neovascular AMD and 56 eyes with PCV. Serous retinal detachment and retinal edema resolved similarly in both typical neovascular AMD and PCV after treatment. However, visual acuity (VA) significantly improved in eyes with PCV, whereas VA was maintained in typical neovascular AMD. At the third and twelfth months after injection, VA was better in PCV than in typical neovascular AMD (P =.027 and P =.044, respectively), although there were no differences in baseline VA between the 2 groups. Age and size of greatest linear dimension were significantly associated with visual prognosis in typical neovascular AMD but not in PCV. There was no clear association between 3 SNPs and responsiveness to ranibizumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although exudative changes were equivalent following ranibizumab treatment in both typical neovascular AMD and PCV, there was a significant increase in VA in PCV compared to typical neovascular AMD. Age and greatest linear dimension correlated with visual prognosis only in typical neovascular AMD and not in PCV. ||||| PURPOSE: To investigate the association between genetic risk variants for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and response to intravitreal ranibizumab in Korean patients with neovascular AMD. METHODS: This prospective study included 273 treatment-naive patients (273 eyes) who underwent 5 monthly injections (Months 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) of intravitreal ranibizumab for neovascular AMD. Patients were genotyped for 23 single-nucleotide polymorphisms within 12 AMD-relevant genes. For each polymorphism, genotypic association with good response at Month 5, predetermined as visual improvement of ≥ 8 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters from baseline, was investigated with logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, smoking, baseline Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letter, central retinal thickness, lesion area, and type of choroidal neovascularization. RESULTS: At Month 5, visual acuity improved by 9.1 ± 17.6 letters from baseline, and 136 patients (49.8%) were classified as good responders. In logistic regression, no tested polymorphism showed statistically significant association with favorable visual outcome at Month 5. When unadjusted for multiple tests, AA genotype for VEGF rs699947 had an increased chance of good response compared with other genotypes (odds ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-9.18; P = 0.0071). CONCLUSION: In this Korean neovascular AMD cohort, there was no statistically significant effect of genotype on early visual outcome after ranibizumab treatment.
