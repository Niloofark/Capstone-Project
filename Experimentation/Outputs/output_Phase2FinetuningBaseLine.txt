Granularity: CLAIM

INPUT (truncated):
<LEVEL:CLAIM> No significant difference in BCVA was observed between the 3 groups at any time point. ||||| After TA injection, FT and VA were improved, and subsequent G-PC maintained the improvement for up to 24 weeks without recurrence of diffuse diabetic macular oedema. ||||| TA intravitreal injection improves VA and reduces CMT more than MLG, which in triamcinolone-treated eyes does not offer further advantages. ||||| The groups receiving triamcinolone had better VA and lower CMT values at all time points (P <.05). ...

REFERENCE SUMMARY:
Although there is a greater reduction in CFT in eyes pretreated with steroids, this does not consistently result in higher VA.

MODEL SUMMARY:
TA intravitreal injection reduces CMT in eyes with DMO.
